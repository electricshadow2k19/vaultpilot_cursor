# VaultPilot Fixes - Completed ✅

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Commit:** 9c5abc0  
**Status:** All issues resolved and deployed

---

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Rotation Not Working
**Problem:** Rotation button on dashboard was not working, Lambda had missing dependencies  
**Solution:**
- Created simple rotation Lambda using AWS SDK v3 (built-in to Node 18)
- Fixed rotation endpoint to include credential ID: `POST /rotation/{id}`
- Updated Dashboard.tsx to call correct endpoint with credential ID
- Deployed new rotation Lambda: `vaultpilot-rotation-prod`

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/rotation-simple/index.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Testing:** ✅ Verified rotation updates `lastRotated` timestamp

---

### ✅ 2. Audit Logs Not Updating
**Problem:** Rotation events were not being logged to audit table  
**Solution:**
- Added audit logging to rotation Lambda
- Logs rotation events with: action, timestamp, credential details
- Uses proper audit table: `vaultpilot-audit-logs-prod`
- Each rotation creates an audit entry with 90-day TTL

**Testing:** ✅ Verified new rotation events appear in audit logs with current timestamp

---

### ✅ 3. Account Scan Failing
**Problem:** Account scan showing "Unknown error" in UI  
**Solution:**
- Verified scan endpoint is working correctly
- Fixed API Gateway route: `POST /accounts/{id}/scan`
- Scan now returns proper response: `{"message":"Scan complete. Found X IAM access keys.","credentialsFound":X,"users":X}`

**Testing:** ✅ Verified scan completes successfully and returns credential count

---

### ✅ 4. Rotation Trend Graph Showing Fake Data
**Problem:** Dashboard graph showed hardcoded mock data  
**Solution:**
- Implemented `generateRotationTrend()` function
- Graph now shows real rotation counts based on `lastRotated` field
- Displays last 7 days of actual rotation activity

**Testing:** ✅ Graph updates dynamically based on real credential rotations

---

### ✅ 5. Account Filter Not Working
**Problem:** Dashboard filter showed accounts but filtering didn't work  
**Solution:**
- Implemented `credentialMatchesAccount()` function
- Maps `tenantId: "default"` to main account ID
- Filter now correctly shows credentials for selected account

**Testing:** ✅ Selecting "My AWS Account" shows 2 credentials
